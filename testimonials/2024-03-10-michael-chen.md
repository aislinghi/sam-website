# Crystal Clear Vision After Cataract Surgery

At 65, I was worried about having cataract surgery, but Mr Dowlut's expertise made all the difference. I had been struggling with night driving and found myself increasingly dependent on my family. The deterioration in my vision was affecting my confidence and independence.

The surgery was remarkably straightforward, and the improvement in my vision was almost immediate. I'm now able to drive confidently again, even at night, and can fully enjoy watching my grandchildren play sports. The clarity of my vision is incredible - I didn't realize how much I had been missing! Mr Dowlut's skill and caring approach made this life-changing procedure a positive experience.
